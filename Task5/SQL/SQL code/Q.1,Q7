--Q.1) Write a query to count the number of students in each
--school and display the school name and the student count,
--ordered by the count in descending order.

SELECT 
    s.school_name,
    COUNT(st.student_id) AS student_count
FROM 
    school s
LEFT JOIN 
    student st ON s.school_id = st.school_id
GROUP BY 
    s.school_name
ORDER BY 
    student_count DESC;

--Q.7) For each student, display their school name, teacher’s name,
-- student’s name, and the number of students assigned to their teacher.
--Additionally, rank teachers within each school based on the number of students they have (highest student count gets rank 1).
